    <h6 class="name">KING:</h6>     <p calss="Speech">Oh, better far to live and die
    Under the brave black flag I fly,
    Than play a sanctimonious part
    With a pirate head and a pirate heart.
    Away to the cheating world go you,
    Where pirates all are well-to-do;
    But I'll be true to the song I sing,
    And live and die a Pirate King.
         For I am a Pirate King!
    And it is, it is a glorious thing
    To be a Pirate King!
         For I am a Pirate King!</p>
<h6 class="name">ALL:</h6>               You are!
<p calss="Speech"> Hurrah for the Pirate King!</p>
<h6 class="name">KING:</h6>     <p class="Speech">And it is, it is a glorious thing
    To be a Pirate King.</p>
<h6 class="name">ALL:</h6>               <p class="Speech"> It is!
    Hurrah for the Pirate King!
    Hurrah for the Pirate King</p>
    <h6 class="name">KING: </h6>    <p>When I sally forth to seek my prey
    I help myself in a royal way.
    I sink a few more ships, it's true,
    Than a well-bred monarch ought to do;
    But many a king on a first-class throne,
    If he wants to call his crown his own,
    Must manage somehow to get through
    More dirty work than e'er I do,
         For I am a Pirate King!
    And it is, it is a glorious thing</p>
