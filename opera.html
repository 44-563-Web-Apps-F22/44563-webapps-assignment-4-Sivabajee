    <h6>THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE OR  THE SLAVE OF DUTY
        ACT II (Scene.-A ruined chapel by moonlight.  Aisles C., R. and L., divided by pillars and arches, ruined Gothic windows at
       back.  MAJOR-GENERAL STANLEY discovered seated R.C. pensively, surrounded by his daughters.)</h6>

    <h4>SOLO—MABEL</h4>
       <p>Dear father, why leave your bed
            At this untimely hour,
       When happy daylight is dead,
            And darksome dangers low'r?
       See, heav'n has lit her lamp,
            The midnight hour is past,
       And the chilly night-air is damp,
            And the dews are falling fast!
       Dear father, why leave your bed
            When happy daylight is dead?</p>
    
    <br>

     <h6>GIR:</h6>    <p>Oh, dry the glist'ning tear, etc.</p>
     <br>

    <p>(FREDERIC enters)</p>

    <h6>MAB:</h6>   <p>Oh, Frederic, cannot you, in the calm excellence of
       your wisdom, reconcile it with your conscience to say
       something that will relieve my father's sorrow?</p> 
       <br>
<h6>FRE:</h6> <p>I will try, dear Mabel.  But why does he sit, night
       after night, in this draughty old ruin?</p>
       <br>
<h6>GEN:</h6> <p>Why do I sit here?  To escape from the pirates'
       clutches, I described myself as an orphan; and, heaven
       help me, I am no orphan!  I come here to humble myself
       before the tombs of my ancestors, and to implore their
       pardon for having brought dishonour on the family
       escutcheon.</p>
       <br>
<h6>FRE:</h6> <p>But you forget, sir, you only bought the property a
       year ago, and the stucco on your baronial castle is
       scarcely dry.</p>
       <br>

<h6>GEN:</h6>  <p>Frederic, in this chapel are ancestors: you cannot deny
       that.  With the estate, I bought the chapel and its
       contents.  I don't know whose ancestors they were, but
       I know whose ancestors they are, and I shudder to think
       that their descendant by purchase (if I may so describe
       myself) should have brought disgrace upon what, I have
       no doubt, was an unstained escutcheon.</p>
       <br>
<h6>FRE:</h6><p> Be comforted.  Had you not acted as you did, these
       reckless men would assuredly have called in the nearest
       clergyman, and have married your large family on the
       spot.</p>
       <br>
<h6>GEN:</h6>  <p>I thank you for your proffered solace, but it is
       unavailing.  I assure you, Frederic, that such is the
       anguish and remorse I feel at the abominable falsehood
       by which I escaped these easily deluded pirates, that I
       would go to their simple-minded chief this very night
       and confess all, did I not fear that the consequences
       would be most disastrous to myself.  At what time does
       your expedition march against these scoundrels?</p>
       <br>
 <h6>FRE:</h6> <p>At eleven, and before midnight I hope to have atoned
       for my involuntary association with the pestilent
       scourges by sweeping them from the face of the earth—
       and then, dear Mabel, you will be mine!</p>
       <br>
<h6>GEN:</h6> <p>Are your devoted followers at hand?</p>
<br>
<h6>FRE:</h6> <p>They are, they only wait my orders.</p>
<br>

                      RECIT—GENERAL

       Then, Frederic, let your escort lion-hearted
       Be summoned to receive a gen'ral's blessing,
       Ere they depart upon their dread adventure.
       <br>

<h6>FRE:</h6> <p>Dear, sir, they come.</p>

<p>(Enter POLICE, marching in single file. They form in line, facing
  audience.)</p>

                      SONG—SERGEANT

  When the foeman bares his steel,
                 Tarantara!  tarantara!
  We uncomfortable feel,
                 Tarantara!
  And we find the wisest thing,
                 Tarantara!  tarantara!
  Is to slap our chests and sing,
                 Tarantara!
  For when threatened with -meutes,
                 Tarantara! tarantara!
  And your heart is in your boots,
                 Tarantara!
  There is nothing brings it round
  Like the trumpet's martial sound,
  Like the trumpet's martial sound
                 Tarantara! tarantara!, etc.
                 <br>

<h6>MAB: </h6>   <p>Go, ye heroes, go to glory,
       Though you die in combat gory,
       Ye shall live in song and story.
            Go to immortality!
       Go to death, and go to slaughter;
       Die, and every Cornish daughter
       With her tears your grave shall water.
            Go, ye heroes, go and die!</p>
            <br>


<h6>GIR:</h6>    <p>Go, ye heroes, go and die!  Go, ye heroes, go and die!</p>
<br>

<h6>POL:</h6>   <p>Though to us it's evident,
                 Tarantara!  tarantara!
       These attentions are well meant,
                 Tarantara!
       Such expressions don't appear,
                 Tarantara!  tarantara!
       Calculated men to cheer
                 Tarantara!
       Who are going to meet their fate
       In a highly nervous state.
                 Tarantara! tarantara! tarantara!
       Still to us it's evident
       These attentions are well meant.
                 Tarantara! tarantara! tarantara!</p>
                 <br>
<h6>EDI:</h6><p>Go and do your best endeavour,
       And before all links we sever,
       We will say farewell for-ever.
            Go to glory and the grave!</p>
            <br>

<h6>GIR:</h6><p>For your foes are fierce and ruthless,
       False, unmerciful, and truthless;
       Young and tender, old and toothless,
            All in vain their mercy crave.</p>
            <br>

<h6>SER:</h6> <p>We observe too great a stress,
       On the risks that on us press,
       And of reference a lack
       To our chance of coming back.
       Still, perhaps it would be wise
       Not to carp or criticise,
       For it's very evident
       These attentions are well meant.</p>
       <br>

<h6>POL:</h6>  <p>Yes, it's very evident
       These attentions are well meant,
       Evident, yes, well meant, evident
       Ah, yes, well meant!</p>
       <br>

                         ENSEMBLE

  Chorus of all but Police                  Chorus of Police

Go and do your best endeavour,        Such expressions don't
appear,
And before all links we sever                    Tarantara,
tarantara!
We will say farewell for ever.        Calculated men to cheer,
  Go to glory and the grave!                  Tarantara!
For your foes and fierce and          Who are going to their fate,
  ruthless,                                   Tarantara,
tarantara!
False, unmerciful, and                In a highly nervous state—
  truthless.                                  Tarantara!
Young and tender, old and             We observe too great a
stress,
  toothless,                                  Tarantara,
tarantara!
All in vain their mercy crave.        On the risks that on us
press,
                                              Tarantara!
                                   And of reference a lack,
                                              Tarantara,
tarantara!
                                   To our chance of coming back,
                                              Tarantara!

<h6>GEN:</h6> <p> Away, away!</p>
<br>
<h6>POL:</h6>  <p> (without moving)    Yes, yes, we go.</p>
<br>
<h6>GEN:</h6>  <p>These pirates slay.</p>
<br>
<h6>POL: </h6>   <p>Tarantara!</p>
<br>
<h6>GEN:</h6>  <p>Then do not stay.</p>
<br>
<h6>POL:</h6>   <p>Tarantara!</p>
<br>
<h6>GEN:</h6>  <p>Then why this delay?</p>
